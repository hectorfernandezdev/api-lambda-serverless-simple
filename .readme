# API using AWS Lambda


Project created to show the process to deploy a simple AWS LAMBDA with Node.js using [Serverless Framework](https://www.serverless.com/).

This CRUD is for players you can interact with the API

## :stop_sign: Pre-requirements
1) Create a S3 Bucket called "api-lambda-USERNAME-ENV" when USERNAME is the USER_NAME defined on keys.yml and ENV the environment "dev" it's ok. 
Bucket example: api-lambda-hectorfernandez-dev
2) Create an AWS IAM user and keep the aws_access_key_id and the aws_secret_access_key
(Optional in live workshop, ask the instructor)
3) Install [Serverless Framework](https://www.serverless.com/) CLI v3
4) Use node version 16.x  (we recommended NVM)
